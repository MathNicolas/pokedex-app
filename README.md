# Pokédex App

This project was developed as a learning exercise to practice API consumption, using the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). The goal was to build a simple yet dynamic interface where users can search for and view details of various Pokémon.
## Technologies Used

- **Languages**: JavaScript, HTML, CSS
- **Frameworks and Tools**:
  - [React](https://reactjs.org/): A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
  - [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/): A fast build tool for frontend development.
  - [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/): A utility-first CSS framework for fast and responsive styling.
  - [Axios](https://axios-http.com/): For making API requests to the PokeAPI.

## Project Structure

The project is divided into three main pages:

### 1. Pokédex

The homepage lets you search for Pokémon by name or ID.

### 2. Pokémon Details

When you click on a Pokémon from the Pokédex, you’ll get a detailed page with:

- Pokémon sprites (normal and shiny forms)
- Height and weight
- Abilities
- Base stats
- Types
- Pokédex entry description

### 3. Full Pokémon List (in development)

This page will let you browse through a complete list of all Pokémon from the API, with links to see details for each one.

## Learnings

This project was a great way to get better with React, making API requests, and using TailwindCSS for quick styling. I also got some hands-on experience managing routes in React with React Router.
